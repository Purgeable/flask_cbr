Need comment/approve:
- we keep flask wrapper abd cbr-db in separate repos (reason: wrapper itself is sereval files and folders + configs, so it better suited for own repo). Please confirm comment/confirm

Try:
- will application work on localhost, on winodws localhost?
- root password of droplet changed?
- not all output can be caught from subprocess?
- fab documentation/review
- review comment in code?

Not todo:
- button to delete all files in 'output' folder - this way a user can check if 
- larger height of main form (double th height)
